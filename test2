What is a private cloud?
A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization. The private cloud can be physically located at your organization’s on-site datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. But in a private cloud, the services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network and the hardware and software are dedicated solely to your organization. In this way, a private cloud can make it easier for an organization to customize its resources to meet specific IT requirements. Private clouds are often used by government agencies, financial institutions, any other mid- to large-size organizations with business-critical operations seeking enhanced control over their environment.

Advantages of a private clouds:
More flexibility—your organization can customize its cloud environment to meet specific business needs.
Improved security—resources are not shared with others, so higher levels of control and security are possible.
High scalability—private clouds still afford the scalability and efficiency of a public cloud.
